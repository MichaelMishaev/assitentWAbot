## 🎯 User Commands & Preferences

### When user says "run qa"
**Action:** Actually RUN the QA tests, don't just explain them

**Commands to execute:**
```bash
# Default: Run high-priority tests first
npm run test:hebrew-qa:high

# If user wants full suite:
npm run test:hebrew-qa

# Monitor results and report back
```

**Expected behavior:**
1. Execute the tests immediately
2. Monitor progress
3. Report results (pass/fail counts)
4. Highlight any failures
5. Suggest fixes if needed

## 📝 Other User Preferences

### Communication Style
- User wants direct action, not just explanations
- "automate it!" = build and run it
- "run qa" = execute tests now
- Be extremely honest (as specified in global CLAUDE.md)

### Testing Approach
- Always run high-priority tests first
- Show real-time progress
- Provide actionable feedback on failures
