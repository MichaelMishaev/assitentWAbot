## 🎓 Lessons Learned

### What Went Well

1. **Early Testing** - Caught bugs before they became critical
2. **Modular Design** - Easy to add features without breaking existing code
3. **Documentation-First** - Clear docs prevented confusion
4. **TypeScript** - Caught many bugs at compile-time
5. **Fuzzy Matching** - Dramatically improved UX

### What Could Be Better

1. **NLP Examples** - Should have added more examples earlier
2. **Date Validation** - Should have been in from day 1
3. **Integration Tests** - Could use more end-to-end scenarios
4. **Performance Testing** - Should load test earlier

### Key Takeaways

- ✅ Validate user input **immediately** at entry points
- ✅ Write regression tests for **every bug** found
- ✅ Document **as you code**, not after
- ✅ Test with **real Hebrew data** from the start
- ✅ **NLP examples** are as important as documentation
