## 🎓 Documentation Philosophy

### Progressive Disclosure

We organize documentation by **what you need, when you need it**:

1. **Level 1 (5 min):** START_HERE.md - Bare minimum to get started
2. **Level 2 (30 min):** PROJECT_STATUS.md + commands.md - Daily development
3. **Level 3 (2 hours):** Technical docs - Deep implementation details
4. **Level 4 (Reference):** Bug fixes, analyses - As needed

**Don't read everything!** Start at Level 1, progress as needed.

---

### Documentation Quality Standards

All docs in this project follow these principles:

- ✅ **Scannable** - Headers, tables, bullet points
- ✅ **Actionable** - Code examples, commands, checklists
- ✅ **Up-to-date** - Last updated dates, version numbers
- ✅ **Cross-linked** - Easy navigation between docs
- ✅ **Purpose-driven** - Each doc has clear "when to read"

## 💡 Tips for Effective Reading

### Speed Reading Strategy

1. **Skim headers first** - Know what's available
2. **Read what you need now** - Don't read everything upfront
3. **Bookmark for later** - Save deep dives for when needed
4. **Search, don't read linearly** - Use Cmd+F / Ctrl+F

### When to Read Each Doc

- **Before coding:** START_HERE.md, prd.md
- **While coding:** commands.md, ARCHITECTURE_SPEC.md
- **Before deploying:** DEPLOYMENT.md, PROJECT_STATUS.md
- **When debugging:** BUG_FIX_SUMMARY.md, commands.md
- **When testing:** TESTING.md, TEST_REPORT_COMPREHENSIVE.md
