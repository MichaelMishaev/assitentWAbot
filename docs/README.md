## üí° Philosophy

This documentation follows the principle of **progressive disclosure**:
- **START_HERE.md** - Everything you need to begin
- **DEV_PLAN.md** - Your daily guide
- **Everything else** - Reference when needed

**Don't read everything upfront.** Start with START_HERE.md, then refer to other docs as needed.

---

## ‚ùì FAQ

**Q: Too much documentation?**
A: Read only START_HERE.md to begin. Everything else is optional reference material.

**Q: Why so many architecture docs?**
A: We analyzed all options thoroughly. You benefit from reading the conclusions, not the analysis.

**Q: Do I need to read all this?**
A: No. Start with START_HERE.md. That's it.

**Q: What if I have questions?**
A: Search in ARCHITECTURE_SPEC.md or TECH_STACK_DECISION.md - answers are there.
