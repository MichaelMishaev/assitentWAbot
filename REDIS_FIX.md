# Redis Connection Issue - Manual Fix Required

## Problem
The Redis password from Railway contains characters that need exact copying.

## Solution

Please copy the **EXACT** `REDIS_PUBLIC_URL` from your Railway Redis Variables tab and paste it into `.env`:

1. Go to Railway Dashboard
2. Select Redis service
3. Click **Variables** tab
4. Find `REDIS_PUBLIC_URL`
5. Click the copy icon (ðŸ“‹)
6. Open `.env` file
7. Replace the `REDIS_URL` line with:
   ```
   REDIS_URL=<paste the exact URL here>
   ```

The URL should look something like:
```
redis://default:PASSWORD@centerbeam.proxy.rlwy.net:19475
```

## After fixing:
```bash
# Restart the server
npm run dev
```

It should show:
- âœ… Connected to PostgreSQL database
- âœ… Redis connection test successful
- âœ… WhatsApp Assistant Bot is running!
